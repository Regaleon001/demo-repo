for x in range(20, 100, 2):
    print(x)

The command for x in range is used to iterate over a sequence of numbers, generating each number in the specified range one
 at a time. In this case, it starts from 20 and goes up to (but does not include) 100, incrementing by 2 with each iteration. 
 This means it will print all even numbers between 20 and 98.


 The command means solve for x in the range 20 to 100, show the result in multiple of 2




grilled chicken= 70

while grilled chicken < 100:
    print(grilled chicken)
    grilled chicken += 2




it means that while grilled chicken is less than hundred, print the value of grilled chicken and add 2 to it each time the
loop runs. I.e it will print all een numbers from 70 to 98
